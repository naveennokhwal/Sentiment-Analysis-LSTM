# Sentiment Classifier with LSTM

This project is a text sentiment classifier built using an LSTM model. The model predicts the sentiment of a given text as positive, negative, or neutral.

## Features

- LSTM model for sentiment classification
- Text preprocessing pipeline
- Modular and scalable project structure

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or later
- PyTorch

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/naveennokhwal/Sentiment-Analysis-LSTM.git
   cd Sentiment-Analysis-LSTM
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
